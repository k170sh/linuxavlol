Project - "Malware Detection On Linux Systems Using Structural Analysis of ELF (executable-linkable-file) and Classification Algorithm"

WARNING !!! - The directory MDS contains actual MALWARE file that can cause system FAILURE. DO NOT EXECUTE the file names starting with "VirusShare_...". These files are only to be used as parameters in the program "LimDS.sh"

Contents:-
	1. DATM (directory)
	2. MDS (directory)
	3. README

Description:-

	1. DATM (directory) - Datasets and Trained Model

	Contents:-
		
		a. attribs.txt: This file contains the attributes/parameters of an ELF file used for the learning process.

		b. trset.text: This file contains the training dataset that has been extracted from ELF files (malware and benign) in order of 					attributes specified in attribs.txt.

		c. testset.txt: This file contains the test dataset that has been extracted from ELF files (malware and benign) in order of 					attributes specified in attribs.txt.

		d. result1.txt: This file contains the classification results and accuracy tested on the training dataset(b).

		e. result2.txt: This file contains the classification results and accuracy tested on the testing dataset(c).

		f. ripperk.py: The implementation of Ripperk rule-based algorithm as apython program taken from the source-
				https://github.com/azampagl/ai-ml-ripperk

		g. model.dat: A machine readable .dat file that has been generated by the algorithm(f) on the training set(b).

		h. reader.c: A program based on "readelf" system program of Linux bin-utils, which extracts the data from the ELF header.

	2. MDS (directory) - Malware Detection System

	Contents:-
	
		a. LimDS.sh: (Linux malware Detection System) This is Linux bash script that takes an ELF file as input and checks whether the 					file is a malware or a non-malware based on the rules in model.dat 1(g). 
		
		b. Malware files for testing: VirusShare_ff0425f68b35aae3e0dbcd7693d09940
					      VirusShare_ff061e942731bc4dbca5bbff8da7f5d1
					      VirusShare_ffb00447d40b0ae015752dd484d09de8
					      VirusShare_ffb437621f3249c647c88350e068fd07
					      VirusShare_ffc7be26912b5aca63e55dc7c830f28a

		c. non-malware file: date 
				     (any general linux system binary could be used
